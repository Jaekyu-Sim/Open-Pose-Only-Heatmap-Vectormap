In here, a 'Weight.ckpt'file is allocated for VGG-19 network weight data and two branches stages weight data.

I couldn't upload the Weight.ckpt file becasue of its file size.

But if you download this project zip file and start training, you can get Weight.ckpt file.(You should download MPII_Human_Pose_Dataset before training.)
